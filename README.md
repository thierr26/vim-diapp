# vim-diapp


## General information

Diapp is a personal [Vim](https://www.vim.org) plugin. It is a work in
progress. The author hopes that at some point this plugin (along with [a .vimrc
file](https://github.com/thierr26/thierr26_config_files/blob/master/.vimrc))
will be all he needs in his Vim configuration.

The plugin currently contains a few commands and menu items useful to compile
Ada (or other language) code using [GPRbuild, the project manager of the GNAT
toolchain](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/GNAT_Toolchain_Intro/chapters/gprbuild.html)

The plugin is fully documented in its Vim help file
(https://github.com/thierr26/vim-diapp/blob/master/doc/diapp.txt). After
installation, make sure to generate the help tags file using Vim command
[helptags](https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#%3Ahelptags).
